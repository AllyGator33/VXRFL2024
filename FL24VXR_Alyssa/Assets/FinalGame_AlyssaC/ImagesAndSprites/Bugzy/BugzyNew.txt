Hey! I need your help!
Some ruffians came into this forest earlier and stole the music from this place.
Do you think you could get it back for me? 
Apparently the thieves hid music notes across the world, but I can’t seem to find them.
It’s been said that someone like you would be able to see them and reunite them.
If you collect all of the music notes, bring them to the platform over there,
and then press the button once they’re all on the platform,
You should be able to restore the music!
And uh, by the way, if you happen to find a bone anywhere, 
Could you bring that to me too? I kinda lost it in all the chaos…
